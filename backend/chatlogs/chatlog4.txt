[2023-12-03 14:13:29] Tom: I think so, but I also saw one hanging by the back door.  

[2023-12-03 14:18:05] Emma: Where’s the charger for the electric drill?  
[2023-12-03 14:18:48] Tom: Oh, I put it in the toolbox in the basement.  

[2023-12-03 14:22:30] Emma: And the microwave? It wasn’t working yesterday.  
[2023-12-03 14:23:01] Tom: Yeah, I unplugged it. We need to get it fixed.  

[2023-12-03 14:30:17] Emma: Did you grab the Christmas lights from the attic?  
[2023-12-03 14:31:02] Tom: Not yet. I’ll do it before dinner.

[2025-01-13 09:05:12] Emma: Have you seen my phone? I can’t find it anywhere.
